                  <p class="p-3">Today was the first day back at school. The weather was pretty miserable until it started snowing (I love the winter!). I was not ready to be back at school. I went in the morning to the salon to get some stuff done but it was hectic prior to my class so I wasn’t able to eat. After my classes I barely ate a salad and headed to my workout class. I was looking forward to seeing my boyfriend after a week. After I worked out, I had 4 hours of acapella rehearsal and was able to eat at 10:30. After that I got into a fight with my boyfriend but went home and sorted things out. </p>

                      <p class="p-3">Today I felt settled into being back at school. I was a little rushed getting out the door for my first class. I did a good job of taking my medications on time and felt well motivated. I payed good attention in class and began working out an hourly schedule for the next couple of days, especially because I’m going to be heading into finals season. The commute home was more hectic than it is usually leading to a stressful time getting back. I got home, cooked, watched some TV, turned in a couple of assignments. I got a lot of work done and am feeling accomplished because of my schedule! </p>

It was difficult to work through that during the day and I didn’t feel as productive as I had intended to be. I was able to go to my barre class which helped and eventually worked things out with him. In the evening I think I was so emotionally drained that I didn’t do much homework. </p>

                      <p class="p-3">Today was a pretty uneventful school day. It was kind of cold outside so it made my commute difficult. I am regularly rushing from Tandon to main campus to make my Thursday evening acapella rehearsals. After rehearsal I typically spend time with my boyfriend at home for about an hour but my roommate was home so we watched a movie the ugly truth, painted our nails and just had some much needed girl time. I went to bed late but had a lot of fun. </p>
