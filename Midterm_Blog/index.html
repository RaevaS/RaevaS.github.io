            <p><strong>Feedback from User Testing and Changes to make</strong></p>

            <p>We had user testing a couple of days ago and it was extremely helpful in understanding how I can improve my site. I was concerned that because I didn’t have much functionality yet that user testing would not be advantageous. However, I gained some really valuable feedback and was able to collaborate with my peers to solve some coding issues on the spot!</p>
            <p>Some pieces of feedback that I will definitely be incorporating into my work are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Making the site responsive (on hover actions)</li>
                <li>Adding a hamburger nav bar</li>
                <li>Have bigger margins – so as to bring the content in more vertically and horizontally (too much white space)</li>
                <li>Use absolute positioning for the main titles</li>
                <li>RE ORGANIZE CLASSES AND DIVS!!</li>
                <li>Align the drop shadow appropriately</li>
                <li>Have the video as centerpiece</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The user testing sparked some new ideas as well as how to constructively improve my site. I also got a much stronger understanding of what is realistic and what isn’t given the time we have. Below are the pictures illustrating: The ample but unnecessary white space and poor uses of classes in my code. Both of which I intend to change.
