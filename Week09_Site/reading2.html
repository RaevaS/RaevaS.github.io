        <p id="text">It was interesting to read this article after the first especially because of the difference in publication date. Technology and the internet specifically have changed so much within that time frame. Even between 2009 and now it seems like very dated to hear about the smart phone boom or sensors. Learning how the Web is learning especially implicitly and explicitly is particularly relevant given the issues of safety and privacy that are a topic of conversation recently. This article highlights the application of the collective intelligence and having users as developers which was mentioned in the Web 2.0 article. I really appreciated the examples described in the end of the article as it showed the ways in which we see the application of this step further in web abilities. </p>
