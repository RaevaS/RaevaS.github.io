        <h2 id="subtitle">What is Web 2.0? by Tim O’Reilly 2005</h2>
        <p id="text">This article was really interesting to read because it really laid out the validity of Web 2.0 conceptually and walked through the features, principles and examples that show the core of Web 2.0. It was also clear in the pointing out how with Web 2.0 a website needs to have certain attributes in order to be considered a Web 2.0 site. The article dove areas that define the core of Web 2.0, I understood them as follows:</p>
        <ul id=list>
            <li>Scalable services (Is this what SaaS is?)</li>
            <li>Data control that increases with user usage</li>
            <li>In the same vein – having users being a part of development</li>
            <li>Taking advantage of “collective intelligence”</li>
            <li>Multiple device software</li>
            <li>The ability to pivot in several areas including a business model</li>
        </ul>
