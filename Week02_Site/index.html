                <h1><strong>As We May Think </strong></h1>
                <h2><em>by Raeva Sayed</em></h2>
        
                <p>This was an extremely interesting article to read having been 
                    somewhat in contact with several versions of technology as imagined by Bush. 
                    It truly served as a precursor and predictor for the technologies we have today.
                     He describes one of the technologies as, “The camera hound of the future wears 
                     on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters 
                     square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 
                     10 beyond present practice.”

                <p>It immediately made me think of the latest iPhone 
                    in which we or “the camera hound of the future” constantly carry a camera with us that 
                    has incredible photographical capabilities allowing 
                    for pictures to be enlarged or projected. Bush’s argument in essence speaks to, how the 
                    work of science should be put towards moving past helping society in physical capabilities
                    and try to capture the mental capabilities. This immediately made me think of virtual reality 
                    and how it is nearing real experiences through capturing one’s mental processing of an action.

                <h1><strong>Long Live the Web </strong></h1>
                <p>
                        Reading this piece from Tim Berner’s Lee was very eye opening on the power of the web. 
                        It felt like a good reminder of the principles on which it was created, and the responsibilities 
                        we all have in utilizing it. Something I had not really considered prior to reading this article 
                        and taking this class is the concept of “keep[ing] the web separate from the internet”. 
                        It really made better understand that the web can and should be improved and innovated upon.
